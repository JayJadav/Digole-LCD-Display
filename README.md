# Build Instructions - Broadcom Development Platform: Digole LCD with Touch Capabilities
#### By Jacob Ladan â€¢ For Hardware Production Technology CENG 317, Humber College School of Applied Technology
<br />

## Introduction
As a result of following these build instructions, the builder will be able to implement a Digole LCD screen with a Raspberry Pi 3B+.
These build instructions will aid the builder in producing a unified product, along with the necessary code to drive these devices. 
The builder will connect the LCD screen to the Pi with the aid of a custom designed PCB, and utilize a small program in order to read a 
string from a user through the Pi's terminal and print it to the LCD. The program will be written in C and the interface used to connect the 
Pi and the LCD will be I squared C (I2C).

The following image depicts the overall goal of the hardware project for the third year capstone of the Computer Engineering Technology 
program at Humber College. This includes two other projects that are to be implemented at a later date, as well as a communication with 
a remotely hosted database. 

---Overall System UML---

For the purpose of these build instructions and what will be focused on, the following image depicts an initial version to introduce 
the builder to interfacing a Pi with an LCD screen. This allows the builder to use what has been produced through this project and apply
it how they see fit.

A weekly updated blog for the fall semester of 2018 for this project as it was designed and implemented can be viewed [here](https://jacobladan.github.io/Digole-LCD-Display/).

## Build Materials and Budget
A full list of materials along with a detailed view of costs can be downloaded form within this repository [here](https://github.com/jacobladan/Digole-LCD-Display/blob/master/documentation/Budget.xlsx).
The total cost of producing this project is heavily inflated due to the cost of the soldering kit that was supplied in the lab during
development. Any generic solding iron can be used for this project.

Notable purchases include: Raspberry Pi 3B+ Kit ($94.95 CAD) and Digole 2.4" LCD display with touch capabilities ($17.49 USD).
