# Digole-LCD-Display
### Implementing a Digole LCD Display with a Raspberry Pi

## October 23r - Breadboarding
### Below is a picture of the breadboard circuit set up with my screen powered on. 
### Connection: Pin01(3.3V) = VCC, Pin03(BCM 2 Data) = DATA, Pin05(BCM 3 Clock) = CLK, Pin06(Ground) = GND

### Below shows that my Raspberry Pi does indeed see my Digole Display on my correct address of 0x27

Initially I ran in to an issue of connecting to the wrong ground and power pins on my Pi. I switched from 5V to 3v3 and adjusted the ground so it was on a closer pin. 

To assemble this circuit I used:
