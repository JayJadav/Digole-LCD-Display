### Implementing a Digole LCD Display with a Raspberry Pi

## October 23r - Breadboarding
#### Below is a picture of the breadboard circuit set up with my screen powered on. 
#### Connection: 
- Pin01(3.3V) = VCC 
- Pin03(BCM 2 Data) = DATA
- Pin05(BCM 3 Clock) = CLK 
- Pin06(Ground) = GND

#### Below shows that my Raspberry Pi does indeed see my Digole Display on my correct address of 0x27

Initially I ran in to an issue of connecting to the wrong ground and power pins on my Pi. I switched from 5V to 3v3 and adjusted the ground so it was on a closer pin. 

To assemble this circuit I used:

[Pinout Diagram](https://pinout.xyz/pinout/i2c)  

Schedule Update: I am on schedule as it is laid out [here](https://github.com/jacobladan/Digole-LCD-Display/blob/master/documentation/Capstone%20Gantt%20Schedule.mpp). Breadboarding was to be done by the 23rd, and it has been completed on time. 

Budget Update: The budget has not been changed as of this date. Solder has been borrowed from the Prototype Lab and the acrylic casing will be acquired on the date laid out in the schedule.
